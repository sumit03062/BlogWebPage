    <p>Writing **clean and maintainable code** is an essential skill for every developer. Good code is not just about making a program work—it should be **readable, scalable, and easy to modify**. This guide covers the best practices that help developers write high-quality, professional code.</p>

    <h2>📌 <strong>Why is Clean Code Important?</strong></h2>
    <p>Clean and well-structured code helps in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>✔️ **Better Readability** – Code is easier to understand for you and your team.</li>
        <li>✔️ **Faster Debugging** – Finding and fixing issues becomes more efficient.</li>
        <li>✔️ **Scalability** – Future updates and modifications become simpler.</li>
        <li>✔️ **Collaboration** – Other developers can easily contribute and maintain the code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🚀 <strong>Best Practices for Writing Clean Code</strong></h2>

    <h3>1️⃣ <strong>Use Meaningful and Descriptive Variable Names</strong></h3>
    <p>Instead of using generic names like <code>x</code> or <code>temp</code>, choose meaningful names:</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
let x = 10;  

// ✅ Good Example
let totalItems = 10;</code></pre>

    <h3>2️⃣ <strong>Follow Consistent Code Formatting</strong></h3>
    <p>Use a **consistent indentation style**, **line breaks**, and **spacing** to improve readability.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
function calculateprice(price, tax){return price * tax;}

// ✅ Good Example
function calculatePrice(price, tax) {
    return price * tax;
}</code></pre>

    <h3>3️⃣ <strong>Write Short and Focused Functions</strong></h3>
    <p>A function should **do one thing and do it well**. Keep functions **small and modular**.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
function processOrder() {
    validateOrder();
    calculateDiscount();
    updateInventory();
    sendEmail();
}

// ✅ Good Example
function validateOrder() { ... }
function calculateDiscount() { ... }
function updateInventory() { ... }
function sendEmail() { ... }</code></pre>

    <h3>4️⃣ <strong>Use Comments Wisely</strong></h3>
    <p>Write **helpful comments** to explain complex logic but avoid redundant or obvious comments.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
// Increment the counter by 1
counter = counter + 1;

// ✅ Good Example
// Update the counter when a new item is added
counter++;</code></pre>

    <h3>5️⃣ <strong>Avoid Hardcoding Values</strong></h3>
    <p>Instead of hardcoding values, use **constants** or **configuration files**.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
const discount = 0.1; // Hardcoded value

// ✅ Good Example
const DISCOUNT_RATE = 0.1;</code></pre>

    <h3>6️⃣ <strong>Handle Errors and Exceptions Properly</strong></h3>
    <p>Always **handle potential errors** to avoid crashes and unexpected behaviors.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
let data = fetchUserData(userId); // What if userId is invalid?

// ✅ Good Example
try {
    let data = fetchUserData(userId);
} catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching user data:", error);
}</code></pre>

    <h3>7️⃣ <strong>Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) Principle</strong></h3>
    <p>Avoid **duplicate code** by using functions, loops, or reusable modules.</p>
    <pre><code>// ❌ Bad Example
function calculateAreaCircle(radius) {
    return 3.14 * radius * radius;
}

function calculatePerimeterCircle(radius) {
    return 2 * 3.14 * radius;
}

// ✅ Good Example
const PI = 3.14;
function calculateAreaCircle(radius) {
    return PI * radius * radius;
}
function calculatePerimeterCircle(radius) {
    return 2 * PI * radius;
}</code></pre>

    <h3>8️⃣ <strong>Write Unit Tests</strong></h3>
    <p>Testing helps catch **bugs early** and ensures that your code works as expected.</p>
    <pre><code>// Example test in JavaScript
describe("Addition function", () => {
    it("should return the correct sum", () => {
        expect(add(2, 3)).toBe(5);
    });
});</code></pre>

    <h3>9️⃣ <strong>Use Version Control (Git)</strong></h3>
    <p>Track changes and collaborate with other developers using **Git**.</p>
    <pre><code>// Basic Git commands
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git push origin main</code></pre>

    <h3>🔟 <strong>Refactor Regularly</strong></h3>
    <p>Periodically **review and improve your code** for better performance and readability.</p>
    <pre><code>// Before Refactoring
function getUserDetails(user) {
    console.log(user.name);
    console.log(user.age);
    console.log(user.email);
}

// After Refactoring
function logUserDetails({ name, age, email }) {
    console.log(name, age, email);
}</code></pre>

    <h2>🔍 <strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>
    <p>Writing **clean and maintainable code** is essential for every developer. By following these best practices, you can **improve readability, enhance collaboration, and make your code more scalable**.</p>
